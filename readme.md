This project was about creating a main page of "odin recipes" that leads to three other pages with specific recipes for dishes I chose.
I practised creating links to specific html pages which are on my computer and external links to images on the web
I practiced how to create ordered and unordered lists and managed to learn how to do it well.
I also used paragraph, different types of titles, line break, bold and italic attributes for pages with recipes.

I like this way of learning as it really made me use the concepts previously presented.
