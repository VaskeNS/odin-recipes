This project was about creating a main page of "odin recipes" that leads to three other pages with specific recipes for dishes I chose.
I practised creating links to specific html pages which are on my computer and external links to images on the web. I also learned how to create ordered and unordered lists and managed to learn how to do it well.I now know how to use paragraph, different types of titles, line break, bold and italic attributes for pages with recipes.
