    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>2 cups corn oil</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>⅓ cup water</li>
    <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt </li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Rinse chicken with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Cut into 1x1x1/2 inch pieces.</li>
    <li>Fill a deep fryer with corn oil, no more than 1/3 full. Heat to medium heat.</li>
    <li>Place egg and water in a small bowl and mix well. Add the flour, sesame seeds and salt, stirring until a smooth batter is formed.</li>
    <li>Dip chicken pieces in batter and drain off any excess. Add battered chicken, a few pieces at a time, to the hot oil. Fry about 4 minutes or until golden brown and done (remove chicken from oil to test). Drain on paper towels.</li>
