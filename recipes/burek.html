        <em>This recipe is Eastern European in origin; being from Bosnia, my mom made this for me growing up and my whole family always looked forward to it! Serve with Balkan style yogurt for authenticity. </em>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <Ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground allspice</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                    <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
                        <li>1 potato, finely chopped</li>
                            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                                <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
                                    <li>Â¼ cup melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Brown ground beef in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain fat; stir in allspice, paprika, salt, and pepper. Transfer beef to a large bowl and stir in potato and onion.</li>

        <li>Unroll phyllo pastry and transfer 2 sheets to a work surface; stack sheets. Spoon 1/8th of the ground beef mixture down one long edge of the phyllo pastry. Roll phyllo into a tube, encasing beef. Shape the tube into a coil (snail shape). Place the roll on an ungreased baking sheet; brush with melted butter. Repeat, placing finished rolls up against one another to keep them from unrolling.</li>

        <li>Bake burek in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
